# TODO — agent (Claude-facing)

This is the mirror of [TODO-arcticoder.md](TODO-arcticoder.md) for work
that doesn't need the user's hands, eyes, or a purchasing decision — just
writing files. Design/simulate/document a circuit here (netlist,
`breadboard.md`, `smoke_test.py`, `README.md`, optionally `main.py`) as
its own PR-sized unit of work, *before* it ever gets a "physically
assemble" bullet added to `TODO-arcticoder.md`'s "Ready to build now"
section. See
[docs/kb/todo_list_conventions.md](kb/todo_list_conventions.md) for why
this split exists and the reasoning behind each entry's queue position.

Mirrors the sibling `aqei-bridge` repo's `docs/TODO.md` (a pure
agent-task list — see that repo for the pattern this one is modeled on).

**Workflow**: pick an item below (top-to-bottom isn't a strict ordering
requirement here the way it is in `TODO-arcticoder.md` — none of these
block each other), design and verify it (simulate with `ngspice -b`,
confirm the numbers, run `smoke_test.py` and get it green) the same way
`signal_conditioning/transimpedance_amplifier/` and
`measurement_tools/capacitance_bridge/` were built 2026-09-13, then:

1. Move the item from here to `TODO-completed.md` (dated entry, same
   convention as `TODO-arcticoder.md`'s completions).
2. Add a "physically assemble" bullet for it to `TODO-arcticoder.md`'s
   "Ready to build now" section, stating its real dependency (check
   `general_purpose_circuit_dependency.md`/`spacetime_circuits_dependency.md`
   first — don't infer one from list position, see
   `kb/todo_list_conventions.md`'s TIA correction) and whether anything
   downstream currently needs it built, or whether it's optional/no-rush
   like `TIA`/`CAPBRIDGE` turned out to be.
3. Update this file's own item count/status references elsewhere (this
   file's own intro doesn't currently carry one, but `TODO-arcticoder.md`'s
   "Next AliExpress order" section does — check it).

## Open items

### `FORCEBAL` / `SIPMFE` / `LASERDRV` — new tier5/7 nodes (2026-09-18), blocked on part sourcing, not file-creation work

Added to `spacetime_circuits_dependency.md` 2026-09-18 (see that file's
"Why these new tiers" section) at the user's explicit direction, alongside
two non-circuit mechanical build objectives (`VIBISO`, `RIPPLETANK`, no
`TODO-agent.md` item — nothing to design/simulate for those). Same
situation as `HVPULSE` below in one respect (not startable yet) but for a
different reason: this isn't a scope judgment call, it's that **none of
the three have a specific part sourced yet**, and this file's own workflow
(design/simulate against a real component's real values, the same way
every completed entry below was built) needs one to mean anything —
`FORCEBAL`'s design depends on which displacement-sensing approach gets
picked (an ordered LVDT, or a capacitive plate read by `CAPBRIDGE` —
designed/simulated, not yet physically assembled — see
`TODO-arcticoder.md`'s "Next AliExpress order" section),
and `SIPMFE`/`LASERDRV` both need an actual SiPM/laser-diode part number
before bias/drive values can be simulated. **Don't start a netlist for any
of the three from the tier-graph label alone** — check
`TODO-arcticoder.md`'s "Next AliExpress order" and "Blocked" sections
first; move this entry to a real open item once a part from any of them
is confirmed received.

### `HVPULSE` — tier7/8 high-voltage pulse generator

**Still blocked on a scope decision, not a part.** The only IRLZ44N
currently *wired* is in [ACTIVELIM](../protection/active_current_limiter/)
(see that circuit's README § Design notes for why it was designed
first) — but per this repo's ephemeral-circuit convention (nothing stays
assembled once its own bench check passes and nothing else currently
needs it wired — see `README.md` § Circuits — built & bench-tested),
that single on-hand IRLZ44N returns to inventory once `ACTIVELIM` is
bench-validated, and can then be reused here. **A second unit is only
actually required if `ACTIVELIM` and `HVPULSE` need to be physically
assembled at the same time** — not the case today: both protect/generate
for PSU tiers (`psu_medhigh`/`psu_high`) that are themselves still
backlog with no folder, and this repo doesn't run the experiments that
would ever need two such circuits live simultaneously (see
[kb/circuit_lifecycle_and_repo_scope.md](kb/circuit_lifecycle_and_repo_scope.md)).
Ordering a second IRLZ44N ahead of that is optional, not a blocker.

More fundamentally: nothing on this bench currently defines what "high
voltage" means here numerically. **This bench's numeric threshold: above
50V DC / 30V AC RMS counts as high voltage** — the same limit IEC 61140's
SELV (safety extra-low voltage) classification uses. Reasoning: dry-skin
resistance runs roughly 100kΩ–600kΩ, but broken/damp-skin contact
resistance can fall to ~1,000Ω — at 1,000Ω, 50V drives 50mA, inside the
30–50mA range that can paralyze respiratory muscles and bordering the
50–100mA range that can induce ventricular fibrillation. Nothing on the
bench today exceeds this threshold (the Lenovo 65W adapter tops out at
20V; no PSU circuit is built around it yet — see
`docs/general_purpose_circuit_dependency.md`'s `PSUMEDHIGH` node) and no
HV source of any kind is in inventory; no isolation/discharge-path safety
design has been done either. **Don't start a netlist for this without
first getting an actual target peak voltage/energy figure and a real
safety design pass (isolation, discharge paths) from the human** — this
is a judgment call, not something to infer from the tier graph's generic
label.

**Once scoped, a netlist/BOM here is fine even with no near-term
physical-assembly plans** — the point is dependency-graph/build-order
clarity, not an assembly commitment (see
[kb/circuit_lifecycle_and_repo_scope.md](kb/circuit_lifecycle_and_repo_scope.md)
for the repo-scope reasoning). Physical assembly of anything exceeding
the 50V/30V threshold above stays out of scope until the human decides
to raise the hazard level of assembled circuits on this bench — don't
add a "physically assemble" bullet for it to `TODO-arcticoder.md` on the
strength of a netlist alone.

## Completed (moved out)

- **2026-09-13**: `signal_conditioning/transimpedance_amplifier/` (`TIA`)
  and `measurement_tools/capacitance_bridge/` (`CAPBRIDGE`) — both
  designed, simulated (`ngspice -b`, confirmed against hand-derived
  expected values), smoke-tested (green), and documented
  (`README.md`/`breadboard.md`/`main.py`). See
  [TODO-completed.md](TODO-completed.md) for the full entry and
  `TODO-arcticoder.md`'s "Ready to build now" for their new
  physically-assemble bullets.
- **2026-09-13** (second pass, same day): `signal_conditioning/
  electric_field_probe/` (`EPFIELD`, tier5), `signal_conditioning/
  charge_amplifier/` (`CHGAMP`, tier5), `safety/thermal_monitor/`
  (`THERM`), `signal_conditioning/phase_detector/` (`PHASED`, tier4),
  and `protection/active_current_limiter/` (`ACTIVELIM`) — all five
  designed, simulated, smoke-tested (green), and documented. This was
  the direct spacetime-research sensor chain (`EPFIELD`/`CHGAMP` are
  named tier5 nodes in `spacetime_circuits_dependency.md`, not general
  infrastructure) plus the `PHASED` node that unlocks tier6 `LOCKIN`
  processing of their output — see
  [kb/spacetime_sensor_chain_notes.md](kb/spacetime_sensor_chain_notes.md)
  for the design decisions made along the way (single-supply ADC-safety
  bias pattern, the resolved "second oscillator" question for `PHASED`,
  and a real hard-trip chattering limitation `ACTIVELIM`'s own
  simulation surfaced). `HVPULSE` (shares `ACTIVELIM`'s MOSFET) remains
  open above — it needs a scope decision, not more design time. See
  [TODO-completed.md](TODO-completed.md) for the full entry and
  `TODO-arcticoder.md`'s "Ready to build now" for the new
  physically-assemble bullets.
